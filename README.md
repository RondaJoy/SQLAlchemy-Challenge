UCB Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 10
## SQLalchemy Challenge - Climate Data Analysis w/Flask API and SQLite

---------------
#### Purpose:
I'm going to Hawaii! But first I want to make sure that the weather will be optimal during my visit.  The enclosed notebook and python code includes my analysis of weather station data for precipitation and temperature between 2010 and 2017.

NOTE: My summary statistics of the precipitation data is slightly different from the values provided in the starter code notebook because I opted to filter out all rows where 'prcp' = "none".  I believe this yields a technically superior analysis and I am prepared to defend this logic if needed.
